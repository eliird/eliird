### Rust

Love of my life.

### C++

I like rust so you probably already know I hate C++ and like to complain about every single thing in it and there are too many things in it

### Python

i hate to program in it but its good an developement is fast

### LabVIEW

Drawing stuff is fun

### Go

similar experience as python in terms of dev speed (python is much faster) but is compiled but i would pick this over python over any day because STATIC TYPING

# Education

### Masters in Human Robot Interaction

Got in to build robots, read a lot of papers on human behavior

### Bachelor of Electrical Engineering/Embedded Enginnering

was actually fun, realized I liked building things

### [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/rust/)

How I found out Javascript land and started having nightmares. 

### [bootdev](https://www.boot.dev/)

Actually recommend this to anyone who wants to learn programming. Especially the course on memory by TJ (the guy with prime) and primeagen's git course. Also check their youtube channels you might find coupons.

### Datacamp

Just get a book for dummies instead, information is often not very deep. But the interactive part and excercises are probably the best in any online courses.


# Books and Blogs I like
- Brendann Gregg's Performance Engineering or anything he writes on his blogs about observability, freaking gold.
- Maxim Lapans Reinforcement Leraning
- C++ primer, if you hate yourself
- The_C++_Programming_Language_4th_Edition_Bjarne_Stroustrup, if you really really hate yourself and there is nothing else going in your life.
- [Just search "Rust book" and i put the link for this book because I know you are too lazy to look other books up and rust scares you](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

  # PS
I am not a rust preacher, I think it is just a tool like any other language (a good one).
