# Skills

### Python

I have extensive experience with python, having learnt it during my bachelors and have been using it for my research tasks and report generation regularly. I have worked with python for 4 years. For the last 2 years I have been using PyTorch and Tensorflow frameworks for my research regularly. I have extensive experience of using libraries like pandas, beautifulSoup, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pyodbc for data analysis and visualization.

### C++

I have used C++ for most of my projects during my bachelors including my final year project. I have used it professionally for half an year and helped migrate code from C++ to another language. My final project was to build a scheduler for a Data Acquisition System capable of receiving signals from 12 microphones and 3 cameras in real-time.  

### LabVIEW

LabVIEW is a visual programming language and I have used it for 2 years professionally to build apps and program FPGAs

### Go

I learned go for building servers for a website I want to host as a side project.
